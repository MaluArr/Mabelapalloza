# Mabelapalloza (figurative name of our festival)
  We intend to develop a real-time communication application using socket multicast in Java with the aid of the UDP transport protocol of communication that aims to establish an effective channel between the management of a musical event, specifically a festival, and its customers, the audience. The main objective will be the transmission of information pertinent to the event and the facilitation of interaction between participants.

## Target Audience and Definition of Clients and Servers: 
  Our target audience consists of companies contracting the application, taking on the role of servers, and the general public, represented as customers.

## Definition of Application Topics: 
### Chat between Company and Public: 
  Sending promotions related to the event, including tickets and offers from partner companies. Disclosure of attractions and their respective presentation times. Notice of safety rules and requirements for entry to the event. 
### Chat between Event Attendees with the Participation of Moderators:
  Possibility of exchanging messages on various topics, such as transportation promotions, accommodation and matters not directly related to the festival, as long as they comply with a code of conduct. Use of the channel to clarify doubts with the moderators and among the regulars themselves.
