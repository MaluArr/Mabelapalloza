# Mabelapalloza (figurative name of our festival)
  We plan to develop a communication platform aimed at establishing an effective channel between the management of a music event, specifically a festival, and its customers, the attending public. The primary purpose will be the transmission of information pertinent to the event and the facilitation of interaction between participants.

## Target Audience and Definition of Clients and Servers: 
  Our target audience consists of companies contracting the application, taking on the role of servers, and the general public, represented as customers.

## Definition of Application Topics: 
### Chat between Company and Public: 
  - Sending promotions related to the event, including tickets and offers from partner companies.
  - Disclosure of attractions and their respective presentation times.
  -  Notice of safety rules and requirements for entry to the event.
    
### Chat between Event Attendees with the Participation of Moderators:
  - Possibility of exchanging messages on various topics, such as transportation promotions, accommodation and matters not directly related to the festival, as long as they comply with a code of conduct.
  - Use of the channel to clarify doubts with the moderators and among the regulars themselves.
